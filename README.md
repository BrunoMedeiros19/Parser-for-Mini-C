### **Phases**
1. **`DONE`** Lexical analyser
2.  **`DONE`** Parser
3. **`DONE`** Latex Report


### **Parser Specifications**

The syntactic analyser should parse programs that contain:

- Whole and real numbers 
- Declaration of variables: **int, float, char, void, double**
- Assignment instructions and instructions **while, for, if, else, printf**
- Data structures: **struct**
- Other commands: **#include**
- Operators: **<=,> =, == ,! =, <,>**
- Comments: text between  **/ ∗ and ∗ /**

**It can also detected multiple errors in multiple lines and tell which **token** is missing.**

### **Observations**

1. ***The report file was written in portuguese as so the comments in the .yac and .l files.***
2. ***The main.c file contains an example code written in naive C (simplistic C) where it contains 3 errors that will be detected by the parser when executed.***

Thanks for reading! :smile:
